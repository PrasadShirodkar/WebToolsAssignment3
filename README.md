Title: Social Calendar MVC Application with Google Calendar and Google
Maps

Objective:
Learn what the MVC design pattern is and how to apply the MVC approach to build a real
web application. A true MVC approach, which is what is required here, requires separation of
business logic from presentation logic (No Java code in JSPs). Continue to get comfortable
with using external services (Google Calendar and Google Maps) within your own
applications.

Requirements:
The basic requirement is to create a “social calendar” application built on top of Google
Calendar and Google Maps. Instead of building an application from scratch, one can build
new applications on top of existing services that offer APIs. You've already gotten some
experience with this concept in the previous homework since you used the Google Static
Maps API. The Google Calendar API is a little more complicated since it will require more than
just building a URL that returns data (a static map). The Google Calendar data model allows a
user that is defining a calendar event to also specify a location. What can make a Google
Calendar social is the ability to share it with others. You can understand how that works within
the Google Maps web application itself (https://calendar.google.com). That's where your use
of the Google Maps API comes in. Create placemarks on the Map that correspond to the
event locations for a week's worth of events.
